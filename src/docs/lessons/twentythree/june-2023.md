A race condition is an undesirable situation that occurs when a device or system attempts to perform two or more operations at the same time, but because of the nature of the device or system, the operations must be done in the proper sequence to be done correctly.

When trying to rename a commit:

```
git log --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit
```

git rebase --i HEAD~3 (3 being the commit after the one you want to rename/squash because you need to be on the commit ahead to squash it)

then do `i` to interactive mode

this allows you to type

instead of pick - change it to squash

then press esc, then :wq which stands for write and quit
write is basically saving

then git push -f

if you want to delete a line of code then press "dd"
