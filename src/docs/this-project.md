What a substring looks like in javascript. Similar to length-1.

```js
<div className={styles.MyStyleName}>[{value.join(", ").slice(0, -1)}]</div>
```

When creating a new array. If you want to two arrays into one array, make sure you do the spread operator i.e. `...`.

```js
            items={[...value, ...DUMMY_VALUE]}
```
